# LiveGlobe


##What it does
It shows live weather for current center of the map in 2D animations and art overlapping the mapView.

Available weather animations are sunny, foggy, cloudy, raining, thunder, and snow.

User can search the place using search bar, and the center of the map will be moved to the place user searched.

##What's next for Live Glob
Create photo realistic style of weather art/animations for when user selected satellite mode.

Show map in dark mode if current time zone is night

In cloudy weather make the umber of clouds, moving speed and its moving direction is determined by current weather. 
(As now by default 3 clouds move from left to right in 5s linear animation.)

In clear weather, location of sun/moon is determined by current longitude and latitude. (As default itâ€™s at top left corner)
